# Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bike purchase behavior using Excel to understand how customer demographics, income, age group, and commute distance influence bike purchases. The analysis supports identifying target customer segments.

## What Was Done
- Cleaned and standardized categorical data in Excel
- Converted coded values (e.g., gender and marital status) into readable categories
- Created age groups using IF conditions
- Built pivot tables to summarize bike purchase patterns
- Developed an interactive Excel dashboard using pivot charts and slicers

## Key Analysis Areas
- Bike purchase behavior by age group
- Relationship between income and bike purchases
- Impact of commute distance on bike purchasing decisions

## Key Insights
- Middle-aged customers are the highest bike-purchasing group
- Customers with higher income are more likely to purchase bikes
- Shorter commute distances are associated with higher bike purchase likelihood

## Business Value
This dashboard helps businesses identify customer segments most likely to purchase bikes and supports targeted sales and marketing strategies.
